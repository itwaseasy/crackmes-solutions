# Solutions for IOLI crackmes

At the beginning it's fun, but at the end it gets boring because of the same tasks. In any case, it's better to solve them without a debugger, it's more fun and more experience.

- crackme0x00: 250382
- crackme0x01: 5274
- crackme0x02: 338724
- crackme0x03: 338724 
- crackme0x04: 555, 339, 780 or any other number whose sum of digits is 15.
- crackme0x05: 88 or 12346 or 664 or any other *even* number whose sum of digits is 16.
- crackme0x06: the algo is the same as in 0x05, but an environment variable named 'LOL' must be defined, otherwise the crackme will fail.
- crackme0x07: same as 0x06 including env variable. The difference now is how you got to the actual code through initialization routines.
- crackme0x08: same as 0x06 and 0x07 including env variable. The difference is how the envp check procedure stores the result. It probably makes sense if you are going to patch a crackme, and not make a keygen.
- crackme0x09: same as 0x06, 0x07 and 0x08, and now I'm not even sure what the difference is.
